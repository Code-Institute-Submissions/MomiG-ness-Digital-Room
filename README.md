MomiiGness is a young lady with profound-hearing-loss who contracted meningitis at age 2 as result she lost her hearing and part of her vision to visual dyslexia and other psychological need has she is growing up.
Her ways of commnication is in British Sign languages[BSL].

## Purpose: 
MomiiGness had some workdone when she was in her secondary school which she unable to retrieve again because of her psycological breakdown as a result of a blow to her head on a school trip at age 16 which had lost her memory during the accident. By the she regain herself she had lost another 3years to remember her password to her college prtfolio and her school then, had removed the hardwork from the school website, again, dissapointing!!!

## Goal:
I am embarking on this project to assist in realising her potentials and showcase MomiiGness' talents and skills for future employement possibly for apprentiship

## What is UX:
There is a process and structure behind generating  the conditions for a positive user experience.UX is concerned with the creation of products which are useable and valuable. UX otherwise known as a User Center design is not just a step but a process. Using the Balsami wireframes, I was able to implement the processes to plan this Project with the principles behind the five plan as a start up for designing MomiiGness Expo! project from bottom to Top
1. Strategy: In achieving MomiiGness Expo!
2. Scope : in testing
3. structure: overview diagram of the design
4. Skeleton: Architectural approach in designing MomiiGness Expo!
5. Surface: Visual software presentation to the user after Deployment.

## Existing Features
As a user type, reflecting on the momiiGness Expo! Web development using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, I want to be able to navigate through the menu item below
•	Home page 
•	AboutMe
•	GallaryWall
•	LiveWell
•	ContactMe 
Without any glitch or irresponsive pages I was able to deriving a code that links all pages for a responsive UX pages. For example
 <div class="col-md3"><a href="AboutMe.html" target="_Next">About Me</a></div>
                                <div class="col-md 3"><a href="GalleryWall.html" target="_Next">Gallery Wall</a></div>
                            <div class="col-md-3"><a href="LiveWell.html" target="_Next">Live Well</a></div>
                        <div class="col-md-3"><a href="Contact.html" target="_Next">Contact Me</a></div>
                    <div class="row justify-content-end mb-5">

Also, the Navigating button such as “NEXT” and “PREVIOUS” is another feature on the page which I derived a code that will allow user to be able to navigate the pages to the net page or the previous page without the need to good to the the home page menu. 
                <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarTogglerDemo01" aria-controls="navbarTogglerDemo01" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
            <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        <a class="" onclick="LiveWell"></a>
    <a class="" onclick=""></a>
<div id="button"><a href="index.html"> </a></div>

At the start of this momiiGness Expo! Project I was able to visualise the output of the user requirement before going into technical details of the development . I used the following resource 
•	Pencil
•	Measuring rule 
•	Eareser
•	Coloring pen

## Features

In this section, I will go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Home Page 
. Allows users to  click on the menu to navigate to pages of choice.

## AboutMe
. This is a brief background of the owner. On the page the “NEXT” navigation allows user to view the preceeding page thus creat a flow.

## GalleryWall
This page displays the owner's artwork in the GalleryWall

## LiveWell
This page promotes healthy supplement as the owner is encouraging her ser to stay healthy. User will clikc on the image or tect

## ContactMe

## Next

## previous

## submit

## Just Juice

## JuicePlus+ image

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Blog 

## footnote

## Social Media

## BSL video

### Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
